This is an automated AI news feed — a personal linklog tracking what's happening across the AI industry.

**What it covers**

Releases, product launches, controversies, safety incidents, funding rounds, and anything notable from companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Microsoft, Meta, xAI, and others building AI models.

**How it works**

A script runs daily, pulls from 11 RSS feeds across tech media (TechCrunch, The Verge, VentureBeat, Ars Technica, Wired, MIT Technology Review, CNBC) and company blogs (OpenAI, Google AI, Microsoft AI, Hugging Face), scores each story by recency, company importance, and topic weight, then posts the top picks here as direct links. No summaries — just the link, the source, and tags to filter by later.

**What the dots mean**

- 🟢 Score ≥ 75 — high signal, worth reading
- 🟠 Score ≥ 50 — decent story
- ⚫ Below 50 — minor or background noise

**Tags**

Each post is auto-tagged by company (`anthropic`, `openai`, `google` …) and topic (`release`, `controversy`, `safety`, `rumor` …) so you can skim by what matters to you.

**Logs**

The [Logs](/blog/logs/) page shows every run — when it fired, whether it was scheduled or triggered manually, and what got posted.
