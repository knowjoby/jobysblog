OpenAI reached an agreement with the Defense Department on February 27, the same day the Trump administration ordered federal agencies to stop using Anthropic's AI systems. The timing underscores a sharp divergence in how the two leading AI labs are navigating government relationships.

Anthropic drew a line at autonomous weapons and mass surveillance use cases — demands the Pentagon refused — leading to a federal blacklisting. OpenAI, by contrast, appears to have accepted terms broad enough to satisfy defense requirements, though the specific conditions of its Pentagon deal have not been fully disclosed.

The contrast puts the two companies on opposite sides of an emerging divide: labs that set limits on military use and those that don't. For OpenAI, the deal represents significant revenue potential from federal contracts. For Anthropic, the blacklisting carries reputational risk but may resonate with safety-focused customers and employees.

What to watch: the full terms of OpenAI's Pentagon agreement, and whether Anthropic's restrictions cost it other government contracts.
