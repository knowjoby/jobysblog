Google released Nano Banana 2, a new AI image generation model, on February 26 — rolling it out to Gemini users the same day. According to Ars Technica, the model promises professional-quality results at speeds closer to its Flash-tier models, targeting the gap between fast-but-lower-quality and slow-but-detailed generation.

The release adds to Google's increasingly crowded image AI lineup, which already includes Imagen and various Gemini-integrated tools. Nano Banana 2 appears positioned for everyday consumer use cases rather than high-fidelity creative work, emphasizing speed and accessibility.

The timing is notable: Google is shipping image model updates rapidly, likely in response to competitive pressure from OpenAI's image generation improvements and growing third-party tools. The Gemini integration means it reaches Google's large existing user base immediately without requiring a separate app or API.

What to watch: benchmarks comparing Nano Banana 2 against Flux and DALL-E 3, and whether Google makes the model available via API.
