More than 200 Google employees have signed an open letter urging the company to publicly commit to avoiding military AI contracts, citing the ongoing standoff between Anthropic and the Pentagon as a catalyst for action.

The letter, reported February 27, calls on Google leadership to adopt clear red lines around autonomous weapons and mass surveillance — the exact issues at the center of Anthropic's clash with the Defense Department. Unlike Anthropic, which found itself blacklisted after resisting Pentagon demands, Google has existing military contracts and has not publicly adopted equivalent restrictions.

The move signals growing internal pressure at major AI labs over how their technology is used in defense contexts. It also puts Google in an awkward position: the company benefits from government contracts but now faces employee demands that could limit that relationship.

What to watch: whether Google leadership responds formally, and whether other labs see similar internal organizing.
