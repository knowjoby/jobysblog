DeepSeek, the Chinese AI lab whose models rattled US markets earlier this year, is reportedly withholding its latest AI model from American chipmakers including Nvidia, according to sources cited by Reuters. The move appears to be a deliberate restriction on access rather than a technical limitation.

The decision could have significant implications for Nvidia's data center business, which relies heavily on Chinese customers running AI inference workloads. It also adds another layer of tension to the US-China AI competition, where export controls on chips have already constrained DeepSeek's access to high-end Nvidia GPUs.

If confirmed, this represents a reversal dynamic: rather than China being cut off from US hardware, a Chinese AI lab is now selectively cutting off US companies from its model outputs — potentially as leverage or as a response to ongoing export restrictions.

What to watch: Nvidia's formal response and whether other Chinese labs follow DeepSeek's lead.
